there are 5 arrays that are used to run this program
the first one is the names of the programs you want to resize press alt+tab to see the name and copy it CASE SENSITIVE
the others are for positioning and sizing 
certain windows can only be squished so much this program was made specifically for a camera system but can be used differently if needed

let me know if theres any changes you see that could help :)
